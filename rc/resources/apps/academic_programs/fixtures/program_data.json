Development is the challenge of spreading social, political, and economic well-being to the entire global community and especially to the poorest of the poor, who continue to suffer massive material deprivation despite the vast improvements in average material conditions on the planet.\nThe Earth Institute, in collaboration with Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of International and Public Affairs, and the Departments of Earth and Environmental Science; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology; and Earth and Environmental Engineering, have collaborated to bring students both a major as well as a special concentration in sustainable development.\nThese programs are designed to: engage students in this emergent interdisciplinary discussion; provide them with a knowledge of the theory and practice of sustainable development; stimulate a critical examination of the historical and conceptual antecedents; have them reflect on how past practices have shaped the present; provide experience in the complex challenges of sustainable development through direct engagement; and help them imagine alternative futures for our rapidly changing world.\nWith help from the Earth Institute faculty, courses for the program were specifically created to address the very real and complex issues of development as they relate to the interactions of the natural and social systems.\nThe major focuses heavily on the sciences and is meant to provide students with a working knowledge of issues on a range of interacting subject areas. After declaring the major, students are assigned an academic adviser from within the Earth Institute, with expertise in an area of sustainable development, who are able to advise them on class selection and career development. Students benefit from a support system of Earth Institute faculty, advisers, and program managers, and have access to the multitude of resources for internships, study abroad programs, and career development.\nThe special concentration is intentionally more flexible, but its structure allows students to benefit from the cross-disciplinary courses and to build the expertise to allow them to address the fundamental issue of how to move towards a trajectory of sustainability.\nThe sustainable development program is structured to ensure that students graduate with the skills and knowledge to enable them to advance professionally in the public, private, governmental and not-for-profit sectors, and to pursue advanced degrees.\nThose interested in sustainable development are encouraged to participate in the lectures, conferences, and other programs sponsored by the Earth Institute.

The program includes five strategically integrated short, intensive on-campus visits.\nDEL-MEM students have an established background in fields directly related to the environment, with a minimum of five years of relevant experience. They are currently in a leadership position, or poised to advance to the next level and are seeking to update and add depth to their current skills, with a focus on management and leadership training.\nThe DEL-MEM melds the Nicholas School\u2019s multidisciplinary environmental curriculum with the renowned \u201cplace and space\u2122\" model of Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. Because of the design and flexibility of the DEL-MEM program, students are able to maintain their commitments to their employer and family while earning a master's degree. Place is the face-to-face component that gives participants the opportunity to experience the campus, meet fellow students, and interact with faculty. The \u201cspace\u201d or distance learning portion uses interactive technologies to complement face-to-face sessions. Students use internet-based webconferencing to participate in real-time weekly course meetings with peers and faculty.\nIntegrated into the DEL-MEM program, opportunities are provided to develop your leadership capacity in environmental management. In addition to threading leadership into the course curriculum, the DEL-MEM program explores leadership through discussions and exercises during face-to-face sessions, web-conference meetings with our Leadership Advisor, select readings, and a \"one-of-a-kind\" leadership immersion experience in Washington, DC.", "published": true, "latitude": 36.0263022, "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/DukeEnvironmentalLeadership", "slug": "duke-environmental-leadership-master-of-environmental-management", "project_contact1_email": "", "project_contact1_lastname": "", "language": "English", "country": "United States of America", "program_type": 7, "longitude": -79.1096901, "project_contact1_department": "", "project_contact1_phone": "", "project_contact1_firstname": ""}}, {"pk": 4870, "model": "academic_programs.academicprogram", "fields": {"project_contact1_title": "", "twitter": "", "commitment": "FT", "linkedin": "", "founded": "2005 ", "project_contact1_middle": "", "duration": "4 years", "discipline": 17, "city": "Austin", "location_name": "", "title": "Environmental Science and Policy", "institution": 4565, "blog": "", "state": "TX", "other_inst": "", "distance_ed": "LO", "department": "Behavioral and Social Sciences", "project_contact1_confirm": false, "homepage": "http://www.stedwards.edu/academics/bachelors/environmentalscienceandpolicy", "updated_date": "2013-02-26T12:02:50", "created_date": "2013-02-26T12:02:50", "description": "The BS in Environmental Science and Policy program integrates courses in natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities to provide students with the necessary skills to investigate the causes of environmental degradation and analyze policy solutions.

The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Environmental Design degree provides students with the skills to understand, analyze, and solve problems associated with such change, with a view toward community vitality, social fairness, and the design of sustainable environments. Environmental design, offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, applies knowledge of social and behavioral science to plan and design community environments that affect, and are affected by, human behavior.\nWhile concerned about humanity's use, misuse, and abuse of the natural environment, environmental design is also concerned with the planned environment which humans build - the \"artificial\" or designed physical environment - and its ability to meet community needs. More subtly, environmental design includes issues from our cultural, economic, physical, political, and social environments. The purpose of environmental design is to gain a better understanding of these community environments, and then apply that knowledge to plan and design improved surroundings.\nEnvironmental design addresses the arrangement, appearance, and functionality of towns and cities including the spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public. This encompasses streets and parks, together with public infrastructure, and privately owned places. In addition, environmental design is concerned with the way these places are experienced and used, as well as other aesthetic elements that contribute to the quality of community environments. Environmental design practitioners develop long- and short-term plans and designs to use land for the growth and revitalization of urban, suburban, and rural communities, while helping local officials make decisions concerning social, cultural, economic, physical, and environmental issues.\nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Environmental Design program offers a pre-professional course of study grounded in the multidisciplinary traditions of the liberal arts and distinguished by active intervention and experience in community and regional environments through classroom activity, fieldwork, workshops, and internships.", "published": true, "latitude": 42.8864468, "facebook": "", "slug": "environmental-design-ba", "project_contact1_email": "", "project_contact1_lastname": "", "language": "English", "country": "United States of America", "program_type": 2, "longitude": -78.8783689, "project_contact1_department": "", "project_contact1_phone": "", "project_contact1_firstname": ""}}, {"pk": 5365, "model": "academic_programs.academicprogram", "fields": {"project_contact1_title": "", "twitter": "", "commitment": "FT", "linkedin": "", "founded": "", "project_contact1_middle": "", "duration": "", "discipline": 16, "city": "Cambridge", "location_name": "", "title": "M.Eng. in Engineering with a  track in Environmental and Water Quality Engineering", "institution": 5997, "blog": "", "state": "MA", "other_inst": "", "distance_ed": "LO", "department": "", "project_contact1_confirm": false, "homepage": "http://cee.mit.edu/graduate/MEng/Env", "updated_date": "2013-02-26T12:06:06", "created_date": "2013-02-26T12:06:06", "description": "This specialty in our Master of Engineering program equips students with the knowledge and methods needed for a professional career in environmental protection.

With the convergence of events such as soaring population growth, climate change and diminishing resources, the practice of sustainability is essential as we face these unprecedented challenges.\nWith the growing understanding of the negative impact buildings have on the environment architects, engineers, contractors and manufacturers have been aggressively seeking new approaches and techniques to make buildings more energy efficient; but these approaches are to a great extent additive instead of organic to the building process.\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that a more organic approach to architectural education is needed to train future generations of professionals in design and construction methodologies rooted in sustainable principles. Ferris\u2019 Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Sustainability is shaped in such an organic context in which education in building technology and design is conceived in a social and cultural context of community planning that values responsible approaches to resource management and the environment.\nThis educational framework provides a comprehensive understanding of issues on a social and global scale, highlighting humanity\u2019s role in shaping the community and environment.

The roles of expert knowledge are in transition, as the complexity of socio-ecological systems becomes better understood. Finally, across many sectors of society appreciation is growing of the power of inclusive and participatory processes for identifying wise solutions to environmental problems.\nOur program aims to train analysts and researchers in such a broadened vision of the possibilities of agriculture. Underexploited ecological and social opportunities hold promise for a more broadly beneficent agriculture. Agricultural strategies of the past century consistently substituted industrial inputs for biological processes. Environmental quality and social equity concerns are stimulating reconsideration of the best balance between the industrial and the biological, and development of new technologies and new forms of socioeconomic organization for striking that balance. The social opportunity lies in our emerging appreciation of the power of inclusive participatory processes to lead to wise and equitable environmental decisions.

The program is about more than environmental awareness. It is also about the farming community. Urban sprawl has inflated land prices and small farmers, unable to deal with rising taxes, diminished markets for traditional crops, and supply and equipment costs, are losing their farms.\nAll this is occurring at a time when the market is rapidly increasing for sustainably-grown products such as cut flowers, vegetables, meat and dairy products. Approximately 85 percent of the organic products sold in North Carolina are grown out-of-state.\nThe unique curriculum offered through the Sustainable Agriculture program has attracted students from throughout North Carolina, as well as many other states. The program provides both the small business and technical skills needed to develop and manage a profitable, environmentally sound and community-based small farm or agricultural business.\nStudents work with fellow classmates to plant, cultivate, and harvest a variety of produce.

Sustainability Education focuses on global citizenship and promotes environmental responsibility. This low-residency, four-year program combines expansive interdisciplinary inquiry with intense individual research and practice. The Prescott College Ph.D. Program follows a cohort-based learning model with ongoing dialogue between students and faculty. Cohort symposia and colloquia provide opportunities for collaboration, interdisciplinary learning, presentation, research, and teaching about topics and issues related to the doctoral student's programs of study.\nThis highly selective, innovative and forward-thinking program is primarily designed for adults with at least three years of relevant professional work experience. The program aims to foster an informed, involved citizenry with the necessary social and scientific literacy, commitment and creative problem-solving skills to engage in responsible, cooperative action towards a sustainable future. Prospective doctoral students should have significant experience in their proposed individual focus areas. This life and work experience may include educational administration, teaching, research, writing, consulting, business, communications, community development, advocacy, public relations, policy development and analysis, politics, or any number of other possibilities.\nThe Prescott College Ph.D. Program in Education views education broadly as social learning that occurs in settings that are both formal (educational institutions, for example) and no-formal (such as families, community events, media, and businesses). The term \u201ceducation\u201d is considered to mean both the act or practice of educating or being educated and the study of education as a process.\nEducation for sustainability is the act or practice of learning how to achieve global and local sustainable communities. It is a life-long, individual, and social learning progression that challenges the dominant ecological, psychological, economic and social paradigms.
