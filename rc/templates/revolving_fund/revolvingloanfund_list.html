<h1>Revolving Loans Fund Database</h1>
<p>The high initial cost of many sustainability projects can often deter campuses from implementing them, despite the fact that such projects often have long-term cost savings. A campus sustainability revolving loan fund helps overcome this challenge by providing zero or low interest loans to fund money-saving sustainability projects. A portion of the savings generated from these projects is then reinvested into the fund until the loan has been paid off, enabling the fund to help finance additional sustainability projects. There are many possible ways to structure campus sustainability revolving loan funds and similar funds. This resource highlights several different funds that might provide useful models for your own campus.</p>
