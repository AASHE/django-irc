    This resource lists campus farms and campus supported agriculture programs that are sources of sustainable food for the campus and its surrounding community. Users of this resource may also be interested in the book <a href="http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=2625">Fields of Learning: The Student Farm Movement in North America.</a> See AASHE's <a href="/resources/campus-and-campus-community-gardens">Campus and Campus-Community Gardens</a> resource for smaller scale examples that provide food mainly for their plot-owners.
