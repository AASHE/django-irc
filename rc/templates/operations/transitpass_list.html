  <p>

    This resource lists Universal Bus/Transit Pass (U-Pass) programs
    on campus. U-Passes provide students - and sometimes faculty and
    staff - with unrestricted local transit service 24 hours per
    day. The most common source of funding is student fees; but many
    programs are also funded by parking fees and general funds. These
    programs have proven very effective in increasing public
    transportation use and decreasing single occupancy vehicle
    commutes to campus. Programs below are categorized according to
    whether the pass entitles the bearer to unlimited free rides or a
    50% or greater discount.
