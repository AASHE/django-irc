<p>
  This resource lists active fuel cell power systems on campus, arranged by size (in kW). Fuel cells convert chemical into electrical energy from a fuel and oxidant source reaction. While similar to batteries, fuel cells can continuously generate electrical energy as long as sources are supplied. Fuel cell power systems are becoming increasingly popular on college campuses, especially when paired with co-generation technology to generate electricity and heat more efficiently. To learn more about fuel cell technology, please visit NRELâ€™s <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/applying_technologies/climate_neutral/fuel_cells.html">campus fuel cells web page</a>.
