    This resource provides links to information about sustainable
    dining initiatives at individual institutions. Links are arranged
    according to the food service provider used by the institution. US
    based institutions may find the
    <a href="http://realfoodchallenge.org/">Real Food Challenge</a>
    to be of additional interest. For Canadian campuses, please also
    visit the <a href="http://www.syc-cjs.org/campus-food-systems-project">
