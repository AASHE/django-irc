  Campus Sustainabilty Revolving Loan Funds

  <p>
    The high initial cost of many sustainability projects can often
    deter campuses from implementing them, despite the fact that
    such projects often have long-term cost savings. A campus
    sustainability revolving loan fund helps overcome this challenge
    by providing zero or low interest loans to fund money-saving
    sustainability projects. A portion of the savings generated from
    these projects is then reinvested into the fund until the loan
    has been paid off, enabling the fund to help finance additional
    sustainability projects. There are many possible ways to
    structure campus sustainability revolving loan funds and similar
    funds. This resource highlights several different funds that
    might provide useful models for your own campus.
