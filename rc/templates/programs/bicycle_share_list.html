  Bicycle Share Programs

  <p>
    University bicycle share programs provide free or low cost bikes
    to students, faculty and staff. Bike share programs increase
    campus mobility by providing on-demand transportation that is
    both clean and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    This resource lists existing bike share programs on
    campuses. Programs are categorized according to whether the
    program is free for all students, faculty and staff or requires
    a rental fee. In addition,
    the <a href="http://www.universitybikeprograms.org/">University
    Bike Programs</a> group may also be of interest for those
    working on bicycling programs on campus.
