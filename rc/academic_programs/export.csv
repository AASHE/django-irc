Sustainable agriculture focuses on production that renews resources. The program is about more than environmental awareness. It is also about the farming community. Urban sprawl has inflated land prices and small farmers, unable to deal with rising taxes, diminished markets for traditional crops, and supply and equipment costs, are losing their farms.
All this is occurring at a time when the market is rapidly increasing for sustainably-grown products such as cut flowers, vegetables, meat and dairy products. Approximately 85 percent of the organic products sold in North Carolina are grown out-of-state.
The unique curriculum offered through the Sustainable Agriculture program has attracted students from throughout North Carolina, as well as many other states. The program provides both the small business and technical skills needed to develop and manage a profitable, environmentally sound and community-based small farm or agricultural business.
Students work with fellow classmates to plant, cultivate, and harvest a variety of produce. They learn to utilize a variety of tools and equipment, including tractors and tillers.

"BA Major and Concentration in Sustainable Development"$15949$"Sustainable development is founded on the premise that human well-being should advance without irreparable harm to ecosystems and the vital services they provide, without depleting essential resources, and without posing risks to future generations. Sustainability means the management of the world's resources in a manner consistent with the continued healthy functioning of the world's ecosystems, oceans, atmosphere, and climate. Development is the challenge of spreading social, political, and economic well-being to the entire global community and especially to the poorest of the poor, who continue to suffer massive material deprivation despite the vast improvements in average material conditions on the planet.
The Earth Institute, in collaboration with Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of International and Public Affairs, and the Departments of Earth and Environmental Science; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology; and Earth and Environmental Engineering, have collaborated to bring students both a major as well as a special concentration in sustainable development.
These programs are designed to: engage students in this emergent interdisciplinary discussion; provide them with a knowledge of the theory and practice of sustainable development; stimulate a critical examination of the historical and conceptual antecedents; have them reflect on how past practices have shaped the present; provide experience in the complex challenges of sustainable development through direct engagement; and help them imagine alternative futures for our rapidly changing world.
With help from the Earth Institute faculty, courses for the program were specifically created to address the very real and complex issues of development as they relate to the interactions of the natural and social systems.
The major focuses heavily on the sciences and is meant to provide students with a working knowledge of issues on a range of interacting subject areas. After declaring the major, students are assigned an academic adviser from within the Earth Institute, with expertise in an area of sustainable development, who are able to advise them on class selection and career development. Students benefit from a support system of Earth Institute faculty, advisers, and program managers, and have access to the multitude of resources for internships, study abroad programs, and career development.
The special concentration is intentionally more flexible, but its structure allows students to benefit from the cross-disciplinary courses and to build the expertise to allow them to address the fundamental issue of how to move towards a trajectory of sustainability.
The sustainable development program is structured to ensure that students graduate with the skills and knowledge to enable them to advance professionally in the public, private, governmental and not-for-profit sectors, and to pursue advanced degrees.
Those interested in sustainable development are encouraged to participate in the lectures, conferences, and other programs sponsored by the Earth Institute. Those interested in doing further work in this field should consult with the program administrator or with members of the interschool committee."$"Baccalaureate Degree"$"http://www.college.columbia.edu/bulletin/depts/sustdev.php"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Sustainability Studies and Science"$"2011-05-10 16:44:49"$"2012-05-11 10:08:49"

None of these central issues can be understood from the sole perspective of a traditional discipline, whether in the social, natural, engineering or health sciences. The PhD in Sustainable Development combines a traditional graduate education in the social sciences, particularly economics, with study in the natural sciences and engineering, to prepare scholars who are uniquely situated to undertake serious research and policy assessments in furthering the goal of sustainable development. The program includes a set of rigorous core requirements in the social and natural sciences designed to provide a deep understanding of the interaction between natural and social systems, and provides students with the flexibility to pursue in-depth research in a broad variety of critical policy areas. No other doctoral program produces graduates with the unique combination of diverse skills and deep insight into the most challenging problems of future human welfare. Together with experts and faculty at Columbia, students in the program conduct research in a wide variety of areas including climate change and its social consequences, causes and solutions to extreme poverty, energy systems, agricultural transitions, water resources, infectious disease, global demographic change, ecosystems, disasters and conflict. Students also benefit from being part of the Earth Institute's research and practice programs that focus on sustainable development.

"B.S. in Architecture and Sustainability"$16339$"Sustainability is transforming the architectural profession. The term has become ubiquitous; not only is it associated with design and construction of “green” buildings, but it is also attached to economic development, business practices, and more. “Sustainability” is a concept that looks critically at humanity’s past relationship with the environment, provides goals for the present and creates potential for the future. With the convergence of events such as soaring population growth, climate change and diminishing resources, the practice of sustainability is essential as we face these unprecedented challenges.
With the growing understanding of the negative impact buildings have on the environment architects, engineers, contractors and manufacturers have been aggressively seeking new approaches and techniques to make buildings more energy efficient; but these approaches are to a great extent additive instead of organic to the building process.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that a more organic approach to architectural education is needed to train future generations of professionals in design and construction methodologies rooted in sustainable principles. Ferris’ Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Sustainability is shaped in such an organic context in which education in building technology and design is conceived in a social and cultural context of community planning that values responsible approaches to resource management and the environment.
This educational framework provides a comprehensive understanding of issues on a social and global scale, highlighting humanity’s role in shaping the community and environment. The primary goal of the BS in Architecture and Sustainability is to teach students to embrace sustainability and community planning principles so that in the future buildings will not be perceived merely as objects unrelated to their setting, but components in a complex environmental pattern of natural features, constructed elements, and the people who interact with them."$"Baccalaureate Degree"$"http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/colleges/technolo/atfm/architectural/BSArch/index.html"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Architecture"$"2011-06-01 14:46:21"$"2012-05-11 09:59:46"

It is an approach to design that is holistic in nature, encompassing a concern for ecological systems, building technological systems, and socio-cultural/existential systems. Ecological systems are studied not only as the context for architecture but also as models for design, providing the fundamental principles by which sustainable buildings are designed and operated. Energy and resource conserving building technologies as well as healthy and ecologically benign building materials are studied so that ecological design principles can be implemented in environmentally appropriate architecture. The emphasis also stresses the socio-economic, political, and cultural/existential context of design as a complexly structured framework within which questions of sustainability must be considered and building designs implemented. The ESD option necessarily involves the development of a broad understanding of architectural and environmental design that is as much philosophical as it is practical."$"Specialization/Concentration/Emphasis"$"http://capd.ksu.edu/arch/academic-programs/post-professional-degree-program/ecological-and-sustainable-design-emphasis"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Architecture"$"2011-06-05 11:22:44"$"2012-05-11 10:10:25"

"Sustainable Living"$17161$"Sustainability is about creating a thriving world in which we lead rich, productive, and fulfilling lives — without depleting the environment or ourselves.
Problems aren’t solved on the level of the problem — we must address the root cause. A polluted environment is the result of “polluted” minds — incoherent, fragmented thinking and action. Thus, real sustainability begins inside each of us, by purifying our own hearts and minds and helping others to do the same.
To meet our responsibility to current and future generations, we must connect with our own inner nature.

This highly selective, innovative and forward-thinking program is primarily designed for adults with at least three years of relevant professional work experience. The program aims to foster an informed, involved citizenry with the necessary social and scientific literacy, commitment and creative problem-solving skills to engage in responsible, cooperative action towards a sustainable future. Prospective doctoral students should have significant experience in their proposed individual focus areas. This life and work experience may include educational administration, teaching, research, writing, consulting, business, communications, community development, advocacy, public relations, policy development and analysis, politics, or any number of other possibilities.
The Prescott College Ph.D. Program in Education views education broadly as social learning that occurs in settings that are both formal (educational institutions, for example) and no-formal (such as families, community events, media, and businesses). The term “education” is considered to mean both the act or practice of educating or being educated and the study of education as a process.
Education for sustainability is the act or practice of learning how to achieve global and local sustainable communities. It is a life-long, individual, and social learning progression that challenges the dominant ecological, psychological, economic and social paradigms. The desired outcome is an informed, involved citizenry with the social and scientific literacy, commitment, and creative problem-solving skills to engage in responsible individual and cooperative actions toward a sustainable society. Achieving sustainability in all dimensions of human existence depends on adopting an educational paradigm that manifest and supports change toward a sustainable, secure society. The Ph.D. Program strives to contribute to synergistic learning and change in consciousness, education, culture, and ultimately, society."$"Doctoral Degree"$"http://www.prescott.edu/academics/phd/index.html"$$"Four to Seven Years"$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Education"$"2011-05-15 11:50:32"$"2012-05-11 10:02:42"

"Sustainable Agriculture (BA)"$18491$"Sustainable agriculture strives to build a food and fiber production system that is economically viable, while protecting or enhancing environmental quality and the quality of life for consumers and farmers. Farmers and other agricultural professionals work to develop innovative farming techniques and vibrant local economies and markets, while protecting natural resources such as soil and water quality and wildlife habitat.
Our Sustainable Agriculture program parallels the College’s mission by combining academic study, experiential challenges, and work. The College Farm, consisting of solar-powered barns, pasturelands, gardens, fruit trees, greenhouses, and a diversity of livestock, is a living lab for the exploration of sustainable agricultural systems. Working alongside faculty, students become involved in the farm through a college-wide Work Program, structured skill-building activities, and careful academic inquiry into farming systems.
Students study the principles of science and economics that underlie agricultural systems and learn a variety of agricultural techniques and practices applicable to the small, diversified farm and homestead. Further classes provide additional technical knowledge, explore and assess a range of agricultural models from biodynamic to corporate farms, and examine the human relationship to nature and agro-ecosystems.
Real-life applications through internships, farm projects, Sterling’s Sustainable Agriculture Semester, and the culminating Senior Applied Research Project prepare students for continuing study or agricultural careers such as research and outreach to farmers through government agencies or nonprofit organizations, public education, or actual farming. Recent graduates currently work at Farm and Wilderness Camp in Vermont, Austin Community Gardens in Texas, Revision House Urban Farm in Massachusetts, and the Peace Corps in Tanzania."$"Baccalaureate Degree"$"http://www.sterlingcollege.edu/sustainable-agriculture.html"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Agriculture"$"2011-05-26 17:23:36"$"2012-05-11 10:13:28"

"Environmental Design (BA)"$18510$"We live in times in which our urban and built environments are undergoing unprecedented change. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Environmental Design degree provides students with the skills to understand, analyze, and solve problems associated with such change, with a view toward community vitality, social fairness, and the design of sustainable environments. Environmental design, offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, applies knowledge of social and behavioral science to plan and design community environments that affect, and are affected by, human behavior.
While concerned about humanity's use, misuse, and abuse of the natural environment, environmental design is also concerned with the planned environment which humans build - the ""artificial"" or designed physical environment - and its ability to meet community needs. More subtly, environmental design includes issues from our cultural, economic, physical, political, and social environments. The purpose of environmental design is to gain a better understanding of these community environments, and then apply that knowledge to plan and design improved surroundings.
Environmental design addresses the arrangement, appearance, and functionality of towns and cities including the spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public. This encompasses streets and parks, together with public infrastructure, and privately owned places. In addition, environmental design is concerned with the way these places are experienced and used, as well as other aesthetic elements that contribute to the quality of community environments. Environmental design practitioners develop long- and short-term plans and designs to use land for the growth and revitalization of urban, suburban, and rural communities, while helping local officials make decisions concerning social, cultural, economic, physical, and environmental issues.
The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Environmental Design program offers a pre-professional course of study grounded in the multidisciplinary traditions of the liberal arts and distinguished by active intervention and experience in community and regional environments through classroom activity, fieldwork, workshops, and internships."$"Baccalaureate Degree"$"http://www.ap.buffalo.edu/planning/degrees/baed.asp"$"School of Architecture and Planning"$"4 years"$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$"English"$$$$$"Planning and Urban Studies"$"2011-07-15 18:29:26"$"2012-05-11 10:44:58"

"Environmental Studies (BA) with a Sustainable Food and Farming Emphasis"$18675$"The nature of food production and consumption has changed dramatically over the last 200 years. On the one hand, the industrialization and globalization of agriculture have increased production substantially and made it possible, for example, to consume fresh strawberries during a Montana winter. On the other hand, many citizens, farmers, and scholars are deeply concerned about the long-term sustainability of the food system economically, socially, and ecologically. Catapulted onto the public stage during the last 25 years, these questions of sustainability range widely - from debates over genetic engineering to findings of widespread pesticide contamination of water, from high rates of hunger and food insecurity to over-consumption of fast food and obesity, from the impact of urban sprawl on farm lands to the vast distance between farmers and eaters.
If, as Wendell Berry says, eating is an agricultural act, then everyone is involved in the health and quality of our food system. Yet, very few people have a clear understanding of how, where and why their food was produced. The tremendous social and geographic distance between growers and consumers accounts for the common ignorance of social and environmental consequences - as well as acts of courage, vision, and heroism - committed in the name of food production and distribution. This distance means we don't know, so how could we care? Knowledge and experience can span the informational gap between our food and us, as individuals and communities. That's why the University of Montana's Environmental Studies Program (EVST) created an emphasis on Sustainable Food and Farming.
The study of food systems lends itself beautifully to true interdisciplinary learning and problem solving. It also has the capacity to profoundly connect us with nature and the place we live. Students will discover our food system's complexity and vulnerability, and they will be able to ask informed questions. Students often learn a lot about the serious environmental problems confronting society, but they hunger for the opportunity to do something about it, something tangible and real. Accordingly, the Sustainable Food and Farming emphasis will give them the tools to do so. Educated, our graduates will be more to able to exercise the privileges of citizenship, more able to care.
Our vision is to provide students at the graduate and undergraduate level with the opportunity for (1) intensive interdisciplinary study of our food system; (2) hands-on experience growing organic food for low-income people on an urban farm; (3) community-based action research; and (4) active civic engagement."$"Specialization/Concentration/Emphasis"$"http://www.cas.umt.edu/evst/students_undergrad_emphasis_sff.htm"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Agriculture"$"2011-05-27 15:35:40"$"2012-05-11 10:12:04"

"Sustainability Minor"$18815$"The undergraduate Sustainability Studies Minor is a multidisciplinary approach in which students gain an understanding of the theory and practice of sustainability. This program looks to discover and examine humanity's philosophies and practices, past and present, as they relate to the natural and social world, and consider what new or alternative philosophies and practices might be capable of providing a sustainable, balanced, and ethical future for the planet and its inhabitants.
The minor (coursework here) helps students develop both broad understanding and practical skills and opportunities that will contribute to their marketability to potential employers, including private businesses that have greened their production methods, public agencies, think tanks, and non-profit organizations. These understandings and skills include:

The addition of the important sustainability knowledge base to their present baccalaureate degree.
The ability to identify unsustainable practices and to offer the latest science and technological solutions to reduce the impact of these practices.
The potential to affect contemporary policy implementation at the local, regional, national, and global levels.
A deeper understanding of the local and global challenges to sustainability from economic, environmental and social perspectives.

"MBA with a concentration in Environmental Policy"$18815$"The Charlton College of Business seeks to meet these changing needs by offering students in the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program the opportunity to earn a graduate certificate in Environmental Policy through the Department of Public Policy (located in the School of Education, Public Policy & Civic Engagement, or SEPPCE).
The MBA program develops knowledge of the functions and techniques of management and blends an understanding of social, technological, economic, and political issues into the core of the program.  It provides students with both a strong foundation in the key disciplines of business and an integrative view of how those areas interact.  A primary objective of the program is to provide students with advanced preparation in Management, enabling them to successfully compete in a dynamic global economy and, more broadly, to participate in society as educated business professionals.  In addition, the MBA program seeks to afford students with a rich opportunity to specialize in an area of particular interest to them.  This preparation can provide the foundation for successful mid- and senior-level management positions in many business, and some non-business, fields.
The Environmental Policy Certificate Program (EPCP) offers an excellent opportunity to acquire advanced knowledge and post-baccalaureate credentialing in the formulation and implementation of policies that achieve sustainable operations.  The EPCP introduces students to environmental issues of local, state, regional, national, and global concern.  It also provides an understanding of the major ecological issues facing individuals, companies, and government today while developing students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills with an emphasis on policy analysis.  Critically important is the fact that the EPCP fosters the development and implementation of environmentally sound policies and practices."$"Specialization/Concentration/Emphasis"$"http://www.umassd.edu/charlton/programs/graduate/mbaenvironmentalpolicyconcentration/"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Business, Management, and Finance"$"2011-06-22 11:13:36"$"2012-05-11 10:21:48"

"Agroecology (MS)"$19086$"The Agroecology Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is oriented toward three trends facing agricultural and food systems: the increasingly multifunctional landscape, changing meanings of scientific expertise, and the virtues of inclusivity. The increasingly multifunctional nature of much of the landscape means that agriculture is but one of several competing and intermingled land uses, and there are choices to be made as it adapts to this new environment. The roles of expert knowledge are in transition, as the complexity of socio-ecological systems becomes better understood. Finally, across many sectors of society appreciation is growing of the power of inclusive and participatory processes for identifying wise solutions to environmental problems.
Our program aims to train analysts and researchers in such a broadened vision of the possibilities of agriculture. Underexploited ecological and social opportunities hold promise for a more broadly beneficent agriculture. Agricultural strategies of the past century consistently substituted industrial inputs for biological processes. Environmental quality and social equity concerns are stimulating reconsideration of the best balance between the industrial and the biological, and development of new technologies and new forms of socioeconomic organization for striking that balance. The social opportunity lies in our emerging appreciation of the power of inclusive participatory processes to lead to wise and equitable environmental decisions. By coming to appreciate these contextual issues and through exposure to concepts of systems, ecology, and public process, graduates will shape the evolution of this new agriculture."$"Masters Degree"$"http://www.agroecology.wisc.edu/"$$$$"Local-only"$"Full-time"$$$$$$"Agriculture"$"2011-05-31 11:30:33"$"2012-05-11 10:11:38"

"Minor in Sustainable Design"$19266$"Huxley College of the Environment and the Engineering Technology Department jointly offer a minor in Sustainable Design. Design is the process of conceptualizing, representing, and creating projects, processes, or products (ranging in scale from consumer objects to regions). Sustainability requires that designed products promote long-term economic, social, and ecological values and equity. The minor provides basic foundations in environmental studies and design, and allows for individualized tailoring according to the student's interests.
The goal of the program is to enable students with strengths in design, or in environmental studies, to gain complementary skills in the other area so as to pursue sustainable design careers more effectively. The program is also open to students from any area at Western who would benefit by the set of concepts and skills offered. Students in the program will obtain an understanding of the natural systems within which human institutions and technologies function, and of the social systems which mediate human interactions with ecosystems.

The design emphasis has a math and engineering focus. Students are trained to design and integrate the systems used to create renewable energy.
The management emphasis is essentially business courses combined with renewable energy. These students may go into sales, marketing or management - areas of the business that involve renewable energy beyond the technical aspects.
The international development emphasis combines renewable energy courses with courses in intercultural studies. Students interested in international development may want to help impoverished communities develop better, safer water or find energy sources that wont harm to their communities. Many organizations around the world are attempting to perform similar community development functions, but JBU has an even stronger calling in this area because of its Christian foundations.
""Many come to JBU because they are missionary kids or they are interested in international development and they want to go into that field,"" said Fernando Vega, program director.
